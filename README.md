# CapstoneProject-PaisaBazaarEDA
Capstone Project - Exploratory Data Analysis on PaisaBazaar Dataset

The primary objective of this analysis is to explore how different financial factors influence a customer’s creditworthiness and to detect unusual or abnormal patterns that could be linked to potential fraud. Through EDA, the project aims to gain meaningful insights without applying machine learning models, relying instead on data visualization and statistical analysis.Various visualizations like histograms, count plots, bar charts, line plots, pie charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps are used to identify trends, distributions, correlations, and anomalies in the data. These visual insights help highlight risky behaviors such as high credit utilization, delayed payments, high outstanding debt, and low credit scores, which are commonly associated with fraud or financial instability.

The insights gained from this project can help financial institutions like Paisabazaar improve risk assessment, fraud detection strategies, and customer segmentation. By understanding customer behavior patterns early, banks can take preventive actions such as stricter credit checks or targeted financial advice. Overall, this project demonstrates how EDA can play a crucial role in data-driven decision making in the banking and financial services sector.
